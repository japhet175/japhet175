**Based in Kigali, Iâ€™m a Frontend Engineer passionate about building great user experiences.**
----------------------------------------
Iâ€™m a front-end Engineer with a solid grasp of JavaScript fundamentals and problem-solving, gained through courses like JavaScript.info and practical projects. For example, I built a dynamic data filter table that helped me get comfortable with DOM manipulation, event handling, and writing clean, organized code.

I learn quickly and adapt easily, and Iâ€™m passionate about improving my skills by working on real projects with others. Right now, Iâ€™m focused on getting better with modern frameworks like React. Iâ€™m looking for an internship where I can bring my curiosity, flexibility, and enthusiasm to build user-friendly web experiences in a fast-paced environment.
